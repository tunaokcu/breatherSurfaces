Parametric surface rendering using pure WebGL. Developed by Ege Çenberci and Tuna Okçu.

Index.html implements gourard shading.

In main run "scene.normalType = 'trueNormals' " before "scene.renderUnconditional()" to view our breather surface illuminated based on true normals instead of vertex normals.

Use ctrl + mouse wheel to zoom in and out.
